WINNER: ${winnerName} (Algorithmic Score: ${winnerScore}/100)
LOSER: ${loserName} (Algorithmic Score: ${loserScore}/100)
Score Gap: ${scoreDiff} points

=== YOUR TASK ===
Write a 4-sentence verdict. Follow these rules EXACTLY:

SENTENCE 1 — CROWN THE WINNER: Praise ${winnerName} with genuine respect but add a sarcastic jab about how deeply invested they are in competitive programming. Reference how they've probably optimized their breakfast routine into O(1). Make them sound impressive but hilariously obsessed.

SENTENCE 2 — DEMOLISH THE LOSER: Absolutely DESTROY ${loserName}. Be savage, specific, and merciless. Mock their score of ${loserScore}. Compare them to something embarrassing in CP culture (TLE on brute force, getting WA on A problems, using Python for time-critical problems, etc.). Make it HURT.

SENTENCE 3 — TWIST THE KNIFE: Continue destroying ${loserName}. Reference their skill gap compared to ${winnerName}. Suggest they should quit CP and try something easier, like frontend development or becoming a product manager. Be creative and brutal.

SENTENCE 4 — FINAL VERDICT: Declare ${winnerName} the undisputed winner with a sharp one-liner. Keep it short, punchy, and devastating for ${loserName}.

RULES:
- Do NOT use emojis.
- Do NOT be harsh on the winner. They should feel good reading this (with a laugh).
- The loser should feel personally attacked.
- Use CP/algorithm humor (TLE, WA, MLE, Dijkstra, segment trees, etc.).
- Be genuinely funny, not generic.
